VinHack - A Hackathon by VinnovateIT

PROBLEM STATEMENT-
Make a portal for the purpose of efficient and effective hostel room allotment in VIT for registered students where students can start a campaign for getting roommates and where people can find suitable hosts to incorporate them into the rooms

SOLUTION-
The basic idea is to build a web portal for the students where they can fill up their details and take a quiz showcasing their lifestyle and their preferences for future roommate.
Based on the quiz our system will provide analysis report and will suggest you your compatible roommate.
You can then view their details and their compatibility score.
Based on the details you can contact them and select them personally.

HOW IT WORKS?
Login
Find your roommate
Fill up the Details
Take up the quiz and find the matches based on analysis report
Pick up your Roommate
Once you find a roommate and if you are in need of more roommates then the person with highest CGPA amongst the already selected ones will be eligible to select other roomates.
